# Web-based-orienteering-map-application
Site which gathers data from imaginary orienteering competition, and puts it on map
I used Jquery and leaflet in making this map application.

Drag the name to the "Kartalla" to add team to the map.
You can select points by clicking them and move the points by moving the marker. 
This will change the routes of the affected teams and change their distance travelled as well.
